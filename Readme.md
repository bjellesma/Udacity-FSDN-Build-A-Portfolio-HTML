<h2><a name="technologies">Technologies</a></h2>
<p>I have used several technologies in this project in order to help my workflow. I've outlined these technologies here</p>
* [Gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/)
  <p>Gruntjs is a taskrunner that I've used to help compile my sass code into css that the browser can interpret</p>
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
  <p>Bootstrap is an HTML5/CSS3 framework that I use to help structure my website</p>

<h2><a name="editing-guide">Editing Guide</a></h2>
<p>To make edits, please use the following guide</p>
* To make any changes to the front end, please check [Bootstrap's documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/) to see if the task can be accomplished that way
* When looking to make changes to the styles of the website, please use the .scss files in the css directory and compile into .css files if possible
